# triadsKivy

Run:
python3 triadsKivy.py

TODO:
Update GUI to something not so kludgy. Tkinker is really the poor-mans solution here.
I'm not sure that python is the best for even creating the GUI but I'd like to 
try to create a new GUI with Kivy and port that source to mobile.

- We should take some time to research whether there is a better solution for this 
 or not. Kivy and python doesn't seem ideal but seem like it should work. More reserach is
 needed to see about porting the source to mobile.
